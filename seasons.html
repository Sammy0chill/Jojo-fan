          <p>Or Stardust Crusaders</p>
          <p>In a Japanese jail sits 17-year-old Jotaro Kujo: punk, fighter, delinquent...and possessed by a force beyond his control!
             Around the world, evil spirits are awakening: "Stands," monstrous invisible creatures which give their bearers incredible powers. 
            To save his mother's life, Jotaro must tame his dark forces and travel around the world to Cairo, Egypt, where a hundred-year-old vampire thirsts for the blood of his family.
             But the road is long, and an army of evil Stand Users wait to kill JoJo and his friends...</p>
